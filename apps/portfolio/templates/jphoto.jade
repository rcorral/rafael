                | JPhoto contains many features, for example it has the ability to upload multiple images at once, after images have been uploaded it makes it easy to edit them all after uploading without having to edit each one individually. JPhoto has the ability to extract

                |  data from images and display it. JPhoto will intelligently re-seize images into multiple different sizes so that the appropriate image is used for the different views that exist.
            p JPhoto has the ability to extend the display of the gallery view when a gallery is displayed in a module view or the component view. This is done with plugins, I created an API so that 3rd party developers can create plugins for JPhoto.
            p I developed this extension in 2009 on my free time, when it was complete it was released as a 'corePHP' product. I'm no longer the lead developer for this extension,  JPhoto is now being developed by another developer at 'corePHP' since the release of version 2.0.
