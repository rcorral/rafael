                p  This project was developed for a company that wanted to offer a service that determined the most influential person(s) or group(s) for a given Facebook or Twitter account. This was achieved by different scraping methods on Facebook and Twitter. The search would start from an origin account and then the search would span across all of their friends and then all of their friendâ€™s friends. The search could go deeper, but normally at 2-3 levels deep you could get pretty good data.
                p The end result was a diagram like this one, a 3rd party program was used to interpret the data gathered and generate the diagram. All of the gathered data would be compiled into Excel files. The files would then get studied and a report would be manually generated.
                p Two people were assigned to this project, one of them would interpret the data, and the other one was me, who developed all of the methods of gathering the data.
